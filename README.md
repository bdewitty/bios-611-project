# bios-611-project
Semester project for BIOS 611
I have chosen the abortion statistics dataset from Guttmacher Institute for use throughout this semester.  
The dataset provides rates of pregnancy, birth, spontaneous abortion (miscarriage), and induced 
abortion. Rates are reported per 1,000 women. The total population of women in the United States is 
also provided for each year. The data does not include illegal or less safe abortion methods. Abortion 
rates are reported by year and age group. The time period ranged from 1973-2017. There are 10 age 
groups with the first set including ages 14 and younger, 15-17, 18-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 
women aged 40 or older. Other categories of young pregnancies include age 15-19 and younger than 20.   

Initially I had a very specific goal in mind when searching for a data set. I wanted to evaluate abortion 
rates in the United States by state and other patient characteristics. Unfortunately, access to this data 
was restricted and patient characteristics were not available for assessment. After reviewing several 
datasets available on Kaggle, I found that none had adequate statistics on abortion rates in the United 
States. However, I was able to find a dataset provided by Guttmacher Institute that suited my needs. 
This dataset is the best option for me for several reasons. Unlike the dataset available on Kaggle which 
was New Zealand data, this dataset focuses on the United States. I am more familiar with reproductive 
rights related policy changes in the United States which will allow me to recognize patterns in the data. 
Also, there are multiple variables to compare that were not available in other datasets including 
pregnancy, miscarriage, and birth rates.  

My objective is to learn more about the relationship between policy changes and abortion 
rates in the U.S. Given the variables available to me for assessment there are several other patterns I 
hope to observe in annual rates of pregnancy by age group and possible associations with the abortion 
rates in the corresponding year. While I am not particularly interested in the birth rate, providing 
visualization of the birth rates and total population of women can provide important context for any 
data analysis I conduct.
